# Notes


- It should be possible to apply multiple discount schemes to a basket of different item at the same time.
- it should be possible to apply different Discount Aggregator to the basket
- Some discount schemes will only apply to specific products
- Buy1Get1Free is only applicable to "by unit" items, and items of the same product instance
- a product needs to be uniquely identifiable, i.e all items of the same product instance should have the same code
- Calculated discount cannot be greater than basket total
